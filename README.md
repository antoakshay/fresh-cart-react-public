# FreshCart React

To use this frontend app, you need to have downloaded the FreshCart Express server in order to work.

The installation is pretty much simple — just run:

npm install

to install the npm packages, and that’s it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Modify the apiUrl.js to the port address where the FreshCart Express server is hosted.

I have already configured React to generate self-signed certificates for the HTTPS server automatically whenever the IP address of the current host changes, so you don’t have to do it manually.
